# Aim-Trainer

The aim of this program is to simulate an aim trainer, a program where one can train their curosr aiming skills in a fast paced, low duration format. The program starts in a menu, where an input of s moves the player to a settings screen, where they can adjust sliders to affect the main variables of the gameplay loop, which are the target size, the target spawn speed, how many spawn, and the time of the progam, which goes as low as 15 seconds. the user then tries to click on as many targets as they can in the time they are given. when the game ends, the user's stats are outputted, and they can choose to move forward and play again. 

This program was written in C++. The basis of it, including the majority of the shape class, the rect class, the cube class, the main.cpp, the shaders, and the colors were authored by Lisa Dion. I added slight tweaks and extensions to the shapes to fit the needs and constraints of my program.
